This project is a chat room platform for NFT collectors to communicate and display their NFTs. We utilize [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a software cryptocurrency wallet designed for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, as the authentication platform for our application. Do not have a wallet? Go get one and try other website!

Our platform integrates with [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), an online marketplace that enables the direct sale of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at fixed prices or through auctions. Through this integration, users' NFT collections are synchronized and showcased within their profiles, enabling easy sharing with other members within the chat room.
